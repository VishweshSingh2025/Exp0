Aim: To understand the basic concepts of Python programming and its use in Explanatory Data Analysis.
Theory: Python is a high-level programming language with a simple and readable syntax. 
        It supports different data types and basic operations used in data analysis. 
        In this experiment, the print() function was used to display outputs and results on the screen.
        Python is used for data handling and analysis due to its efficiency.
Conclusion: The experiment helped in understanding basic Python concepts and the use of the print() function for displaying output.
